# Trippy-Shape-Drawing
It simulates the trajectory of a point somewhere on a cycloid drawing machine. I kept adding gears to the gear train to get nice shapes. The code also stores the point array in a txt file called "outputx.txt" in case you want to import those points another software.



*2 gears; one slidong link on a slot and a point on the smaller gear. Shape drawn on the larger gear
*3 gears; one slidong link on a moving slot and a point on the smaller gear. shape drawing on the middle gear
*4 gears is yet to be started
